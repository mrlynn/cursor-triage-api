/**
 * The cross-runtime comparison envelope.
 *
 * This file is DUPLICATED, near-identically, in
 * https://github.com/mrlynn/claude-triage-api at the same path. That is
 * deliberate and it is the same trade the guardrail code makes: two teaching
 * repos that must not depend on each other at runtime, because the whole
 * point of the comparison is that each side runs
 * on its own SDK, its own key, and its own process. A shared npm package
 * would make "they agree" an artifact of shared code rather than a finding.
 *
 * The cost of that trade is drift. `ENVELOPE_VERSION` is how drift becomes
 * loud instead of silent: the report refuses to merge envelopes that disagree
 * on it, rather than rendering a table whose columns mean different things on
 * different rows.
 *
 * WHY AN ENVELOPE AT ALL, rather than one script that calls both services:
 * one process holding both SDKs would share a Node event loop, a DNS cache
 * and a machine, and the latency column — the headline number — would be
 * measuring contention between the two clients. Each repo produces its own
 * envelope from its own run. `compare-report.ts` stitches them by case id
 * afterwards and never makes a network call.

 * decision — a Cursor agent run is a full agent loop, and a twelve-case
 * sweep is the wrong first instrument against it. Read the disagreement
 * matrix here, not the accuracy percentage: three cases cannot support a
 * percentage worth quoting, and the report says so in its own output.
